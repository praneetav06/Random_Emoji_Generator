# Random Emoji Generator

A random emoji is generated every time the user hovers on the emoji

How It Works
HTML: Provides the structure of the application, including a button and a display area for the emoji.
CSS: Adds styling to make the application visually appealing.
JavaScript: Implements the logic for generating a random emoji from a predefined list.
